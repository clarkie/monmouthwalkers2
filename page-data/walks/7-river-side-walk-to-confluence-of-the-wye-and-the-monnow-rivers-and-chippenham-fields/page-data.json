Approx. 2.0 miles. No stiles. Allow 1 hour","intro":"This walk takes you along the River Monnow to its confluence with the River Wye.","content":["From Agincourt Square, walk down Monnow Street to the old Monnow bridge. Do not cross the bridge but turn left and follow the River Monnow on your right, watching for the kingfishers that speed up and down this stretch of river. Pass under the dual carriageway and turn left with allotments on your right. Go through gate into Chippenham Mead. Many of the trees in this meadow have been donated by local people, there is an information board on your left as you enter. Turn right and follow path to the River Wye . Turn right at a seat and follow the path with the river on your left. There are almost always a number of swans on this part of the river and they nest on the small island. An old iron railway bridge can be seen in the distance and if the river is not in spate you will notice a small beach. Walk to end where River Monnow flows into River Wye. ","Retrace your steps beside the River Wye, passing the seats, and head into a small wooded area.  Follow the path as it loops round to the left and brings you back to the allotments. ","Keep the allotments on your left. Before you turn right to go back under the dual carriageway, take a moment to look at the notice board on your left.  The board tells of the elephant who escaped from the fair and had a dip in the river before being caught! In a separate elephant-related incident, local people remember the famous comedian and singer Harry Secombe falling from an elephant during a visit to the town many years ago. Fortunately both Harry and the elephant escaped injury!","Go under the dual carriageway and turn right up the second steps and then down more steps to walk past tennis courts on your left.  St Mary’s Church spire can be seen as you enter the next field. Continue straight on this path, past the playing fields, to reach a street. Go straight ahead and, shortly after the street bears left, turn right at the Rugby Club and Police Station. Turn left  into Glendower Street car park.  At the top left hand corner of the car park, go under the decorative arch and head for two old streetlamps. Through the small cobbled courtyard you’ll come back to the Shire Hall and Agincourt Square."],"mapImage":"walk-7.png","osLink":"https://osmaps.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/route/8642082/Walk-7-Riverside-Walk","gpxLink":"Walk 7 Riverside Walk.gpx"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
